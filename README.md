Product  App

This is a simple React-based application that allows users to manage a list of products. Users can add new products, search for products by name, and remove products from the list. The application also features user authentication, where users must log in to access the home page and can log out when they are done.

Features
Login Authentication: Users must log in with their credentials to access the home page.
Add Product: Users can add new products with a name and price.
Search Products: Users can search for products by name.
Remove Product: Users can remove products from the list.
Persistent State: The application uses localStorage to persist the login state and products list.
Logout: Users can log out, which will clear their session and return them to the login page.
